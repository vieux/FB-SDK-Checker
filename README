On 10 Apr 2012 a blog post from Parse (http://blog.parse.com/2012/04/10/discovering-a-major-security-hole-in-facebooks-android-sdk/)
indicates they found a major security issue in the Facebook SDK. they reported the issue in mid-february and the issue is now solved.

But tons of apps didn't update the facebook SDK yet and still have the security hole.

With FB SDK Checker, you can check if any of you app is exposing your access token.

(For exemple, Draw Something is exposing your access token each time you launch the app.)
